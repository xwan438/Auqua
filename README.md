Main idea：
This report is dedicated to solving how to improve aquaculture monitoring systems through the use of automation in the context of oyster farming. In this report, we introduce the background, existing problems and a cost effective automated based system that can be used to replace manual operations. 
Our project uses the automated environment built by Python and Azure cloud to improve our services and more effectively monitor the ecosystem of oysters.
